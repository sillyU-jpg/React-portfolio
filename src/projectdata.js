At its core was a Python-powered AI system utilizing the YOLOv4 object detection model, trained specifically on New Zealand waste and recycling materials. Additionally, we developed a visual interface that displayed real-time recycling statistics and featured interactive games for educational engagement. The entire system was optimized to run on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer."
